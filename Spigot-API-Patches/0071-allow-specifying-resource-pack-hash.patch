+     * The player's client will download the new resource pack asynchronously
+     * in the background, and will automatically switch to it once the
+     * download is complete. If the client has downloaded and cached the same
+     * resource pack in the past, it will perform a quick timestamp check
+     * over the network to determine if the resource pack has changed and
+     * needs to be downloaded again. When this request is sent for the very
+     * first time from a given server, the client will first display a
+     * confirmation GUI to the player before proceeding with the download.

+     * Notes:
+     * <ul>
+     * <li>Players can disable server resources on their client, in which
+     *     case this method will have no affect on them.
+     * <li>There is no concept of resetting resource packs back to default
+     *     within Minecraft, so players will have to relog to do so.
